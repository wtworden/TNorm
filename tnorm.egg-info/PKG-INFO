Description: # TNorm
        
        TNorm is a package for computing the Thurston norm unit ball of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Currently, tnorm must be installed in Sage, and Sage must have Regina and SnapPy installed. To instal TNorm:
        
        $ sage -pip install tnorm
        
        To run the tnorm graphical user interface app:
        
        $ sage -python -m tnorm.app
        
        In a future release, we plan to remove the dependence on Sage.
        
        Support for hyperbolic 3-manifolds that are not multi-component links in rational homology 3-spheres has been added very recently, and has not been thoroughly tested yet. If you get any results that don't make sense, please email me at william.worden@rice.edu.
        
        TO DO:
        
        * add feature: determine fiberedness of a hyp 3-mfld (and hence knot genus of a knot)
        * remove Sage dependence.
        * better documentation throughout.
        * some optimization for speed is probably still possible.
