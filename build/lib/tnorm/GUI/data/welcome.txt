             |         To get started, enter the name of a manifold in the          
             +---------Manifold field, and click Load. Any string accepted          
                       by SnapPy is accepted here, e.g., '4_1', 'DT:[(6,8,2,4)]',   
                       'L5a1', though for computations to be correct the manifold   
                       must be a link in a homology 3-sphere. To open a file        
                       containing a triangulation (with extention .tri), type       
                       'file' and click Load.                                       
                                                                                                       
                       After loading a manifold, click the 'norm ball' or           
                       'dual norm ball' tabs to view more detailed information      
                       about each, or click on the 'qton surfaces' tab to view 
                       information about all quad transversely oriented normal
                       surfaces (not just vertices of the norm ball).

                       In the case where the Thurston norm is a semi-norm (and 
                       not a norm), e.g., when the manifold is not hyperbolic,
                       things are more complicated. In this case, the norm ball
                       is a non-compact polyhedron, so we can only graph its
                       projection to the subspace in which it is a norm. We also
                       give the option in this case of viewing the convex hull of
                       the image in H2 of normal surfaces having negative Euler
                       characteristic (this is a finite polyhedron).
